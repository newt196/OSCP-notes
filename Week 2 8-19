Smells like SQL injection
https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/13650 (this doesnt make sense)

Info on Blind SQL injection.
Use cases
-Testing the veluerability
-Findign the table name
-Exporting a value

Every techniques are based on the 'guess attack', because we only have two different input:
TRUE or FALSE. 
From his example, we have a site that is 
site.com/news.php?id=2

pdf break down, thje result break down is 
In the example site.com/news.php?id=2, the website executes the SQL query 
SELECT * FROM news WHERE ID = 2. 
This means the website is retrieving all columns (*) from the news table where the ID column matches the value 2. 
The URL parameter (id=2) is used to specify which row in the news table should be selected and displayed on the page. 
This process is common in dynamic websites that retrieve and display data from a database based on user input or URL parameters.

to start suerveying the site we 
site.com/news.php?id=2 and 1=0

In this case the query will not return anything (FALSE) because 1 is different from 0; Let's do
the litmus test: try to get the TRUE statement forcing the AND to be TRUE;
site.com/news.php?id=2 and 0=0
Basic explenation, everything else was to dank

Seems the point of this is to fine the colums within the site.
