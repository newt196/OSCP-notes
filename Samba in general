Kenobi should be done to better understand Samba exploits.

Samba shares
Nmap will typically provide most results and open and hidden shares with the samba scripts enabled and used.
When enumerating shares a $ may be used to hide a share from network users

nmap 
nmap --script smb-enum-users.nse -p445 <host>

From the book:
Attackers may also utilize the Metasploit module, auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers, to
perform the activity. Figure 3.31 shows the successful enumeration of users on a Windows system
running Metasploitable3:

may have to be careful if you commit to using metaplot here. 

golden standard for enumerating shares further. 
enum4linux [options] targetip

• -U: Get user list
• -M: Get machine list
• -S: Get share list
• -P: Get password policy information
• -G: Get group and member list
• -d: Be detailed; applies to -U and -S
• -u user: Specify the username to use (default "")
• -p pass: Specify the password to use (default "")

RPCCLIENT (Windows machines and domain)
for further enumeration of an n active directory environment. 

Further info is needed for CrackMapExec (again Windows environment)

Can be used to further exploit SMB
Protocols: CME supports SMB, MSSQL, LDAP, WINRM, and SSH.
Seems like a hash is needed for cracking an already created username and hash
It can be used in recon, credential validation, post exploitation, priv esc

Seems like hashcat but for specific services within AD.
