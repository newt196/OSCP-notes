Godsend: Basic Linux Privilege Escalation - g0tmi1k (need to go through this)
Processes running as root
“ps aux | grep root”
If we can write to etc/passwd we can make a user
If we can view the /etc/shadow we can crack passwords

If a user can execute a SUID binary with he owner as root, they can escalate privileges
Google the found service and see if there is a vulnerability
Cron job can also be exploited if it is running as root.
In addition to we can edit the file like a reverse shell and connect with root.
Watch timing though, sounds like a rabbit hole

Service to note pspy

Seems to be a bit tough
In addition to enemrtating windows and elevating permissions
