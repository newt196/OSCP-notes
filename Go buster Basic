Gobuster for nerds

Notes for better quality scans.

1. Use Quality Wordlists:
Custom Wordlists: Create or curate custom wordlists tailored to the target application. For example, if you're testing a WordPress site, use a WordPress-specific wordlist.

3. Use Recursive Scanning:
Recursive Search (-r): Enable recursive scanning to dive into subdirectories that are discovered during the scan.
Directory Depth (-l): Limit the depth of recursion to avoid excessively deep scans that could take too long.

5. Handle Status Codes:
Ignore Certain Status Codes (-b 403): Sometimes, servers return 403 (Forbidden) for valid resources. You can choose to ignore these, or you may want to include them depending on the context.

7. Incorporate SSL/TLS:
HTTPS URLs (-k): Use the -k flag if you need to ignore SSL/TLS certificate errors when scanning HTTPS sites.
Specify Ports (-p): Manually specify non-standard ports if the web service is running on a port other than 80 or 443.


default seems to be gobuster dir -u 10.10.10.10 -x php,html,css,js,txt,pdf -w wordlist
-u: This option specifies the URL or IP address of the target web server.

-x php,html,css,js,txt,pdf:
-x: This option specifies the file extensions that gobuster should append to each word in the wordlist when brute-forcing.
Interesting to note, altgfhough I dont thinkk this will chaneg (something to be aware about) 
Example: If the wordlist contains admin, gobuster will check for:
admin.php
admin.html
admin.css
admin.js
admin.txt
admin.pdf

-w wordlist:

-w: This option specifies the path to the wordlist file that gobuster will use for brute-forcing.
