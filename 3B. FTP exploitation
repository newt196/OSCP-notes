FTP exploitation 

FTP PUT Method
•	Whenever FTP allows the PUT method, there may be chances that the files can be accessed from a web application's webroot or any directory accessible via the web app
•	In order terms, files uploaded through the FTP server can be accesses through the HTTP server
•	This can be useful to upload a reverse shell through the FTP server and running it through the HTTP Server

FTP Anonymous Access
•	When allowed, a server can offer anonymous FTP access.
•	Since there are security risks associated with such a public FTP server, the options for users are usually limited.
•	To authenticate using anonymous access: ftp anonymous@server-ip followed by any password

Connecting to ftp:
•	ftp <FQDN/IP>
•	ftp username@ip
•	nc -nv <FQDN/IP> 21
•	telnet <FQDN/IP> 21
•	Interact with the FTP service on the target using encrypted connection: openssl s_client -connect <FQDN/IP>:21 -starttls ftp
•	Download all available files on the target FTP Server: wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@<target>

FTP Methods
1.	connect - Sets the remote host for file transfers.
2.	get - Download a file from the ftp server.
3.	put - Upload a local file to the ftp server.
4.	quit - Exits ftp.
5.	status - Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.
6.	verbose - Toggle verbose mode


Bruteforcing with Hydra: hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://192.168.2.142

FTP Useful Files
•	The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in /etc/vsftpd.conf
•	The file /etc/ftpusers is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service.
