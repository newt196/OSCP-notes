Curl in its basic form 
curl http://example.com -o output.html
the output works goes the working directory 
gpt says: The "current working directory" is the directory you're in when you execute the command in your terminal or command prompt.


so if we cd in /home exsecute execute http://example.com -o output.html
if we now cd into /homew and execute ls > we will see /home/output.html
