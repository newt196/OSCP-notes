OCSP is scheduled for mid January

The study plan for the next 5 months (as of Sept).

Weekdays: MIN 2 hours of study & 1 hour of lab or ctf
Weekends: LABS LABS LABS (3 hours MIN)


I am fortunate to have connections with a senior director that has shared his notes after taken the OSCP and passing for the second time.

The notes consist of 1200 pages of somewhat detailed analysis of each relevant service, port, and box that the director has used.
Need to device a way to disseminate the information provided to me.
