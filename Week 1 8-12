SMB Enumeration Port 139(Netbios) | 445
Need an advanced understanding put here at the end of the week. 
From my understanding, there are 4 tools that help to enumerate SMB. Both on Windows SMB and Linux Samab (which is new)
Nmap NSE | nmap scriping language | based on the Lua programming language |
Need specific information on the NSE

example script found in OSCP video
nmap<ip> --script=sm-enum* -p 445 -vvv (unsure if this is a prebuilt script or a script that is needing to be built)

seems after enumerating users, we can bruteforce users passwords. RID 500==admin rid==1000dfirst user

enum4linux (once a Windows machine has been discovered)
smbclient (once a Unix/Linux machine has been discovered)

This is big
enum4linux | like nmap but only for enumerating SMB shares in a windows environment
Notes: Can be used to Retrieve Usernames, Enumerate Shares, Check Password Policies, List Group Memberships, Identify Operating System Information, Null Session Enumeration.
format = enum4linux -v(verbose) -U(userlisting) -n(null sessions | enumerating without requiring authentication) -a(all enumration)
Something to note: enum4linux can generate a lot of traffic, which might be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS). It's often considered a "noisy" tool because it performs many requests in a short time.

This is big
smbclient | Samba for Linux
Format = smbclient //server/share -U username  
-n(anonymous)


Need more info on RPC client
rpclient
Important to note: Linux>enumerating Windows

Network enumeration 
Nmap and massscan enumeration understanding needs to be put here at the end of the week. 


What does it mean to gain shell?
Need red team and gpt answer
RED TEAM:
GTP: " it means that they have obtained command-line access to a system within that environment, t"
Reverse Shell vs. Bind Shell:

Reverse Shell: The target machine connects back to the attacker, as explained earlier. This can bypass firewalls because the connection is outgoing from the target.
Bind Shell: The target machine listens for a connection on a specific port, and the attacker connects to it. This is less common because it requires an open port on the target machine.
