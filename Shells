Bind Connection via port 4444 

Good when a firewall is not up
op[ening a port that we can listen to on the open port on the victims machine

Reverese Shell Listner port 4444 inbound connections on port 4444 and the victim connects back to us

Typically stars with 
nc -nlvp <port>

can determine if a shell is bad...typically with sudo -l

knwoing if we need to use X64 and x86
