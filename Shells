Bind shell vs a reverse shell


Bind Connection via port 4444 

Good when a firewall is not up
opening a port that we can listen to on the open port on the victims machine

Reverse Shell Listener port 4444 inbound connections on port 4444 and the victim connects back to us

Typically stars with 
nc -nlvp <port>

can determine if a shell is bad...typically with sudo -l

knowing if we need to use X64 and x86

What about upgrading a shell
